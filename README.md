# Telegram-Contact-Transfer
A \script to transfer your Telegram contact list from one account to another. It uses the Telethon library and prompts the user for the API ID/Hash for both the source (old) account and the destination (new) account. It automatically fetches all contacts with phone numbers and imports them.
